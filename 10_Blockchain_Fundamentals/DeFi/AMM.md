- def: Price matching method automatically decided by the market conditions.
- ELI5: You & I agreed to exchange tumbler and pens. I raise up my hand to call the middleman, then he shows the exchange ratio and takes a tumbler from me and 2 pens from you and swap them to each other.
- Pros: No need for recording all orders that the market makers created.
- Cons: Overpay possibilities; ELI5 - I wanted to get 3 pens!!
