## Market Maker
- def: participants who suggest exchanges -> add liquidities
- ELI5: If I ask you "I'll give you a tumbler if you give me pens." I suggest exchange, so I'm a market maker. (q: the suggested is market maker too? Only entered to market can be market maker?)
- Then, how to agree the price? There are two mechanisms: Order Books, AMMs
