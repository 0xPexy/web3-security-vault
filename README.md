# Web3 Security Knowledge Base

Welcome to my digital garden dedicated to Web3 and Smart Contract Security. This vault serves as my personal, ever-evolving knowledge base where I explore, connect, and refine my understanding of the decentralized world.

As an aspiring Smart Contract Auditor, I believe that a deep, structured understanding of vulnerabilities, design patterns, and the underlying technology is paramount. This repository is a testament to my commitment to continuous learning and rigorous analysis.

## üß† Philosophy

This knowledge base is built upon the principles of **Zettelkasten** and **Atomic Notes**. Each note is a single, self-contained idea, densely linked to others to create a web of interconnected knowledge. This approach helps in:
- **Discovering novel connections** between different concepts.
- **Identifying knowledge gaps** through a bottom-up approach.
- **Building a robust mental model** of complex systems.

## üß≠ How to Navigate

The best way to explore this vault is to start with the **Maps of Content (MOCs)**, which act as curated entry points into major topics.

- **[[MOC - Smart Contract Security]]**: A comprehensive overview of vulnerabilities, best practices, and audit techniques.
- **[[MOC - DeFi Fundamentals]]**: Core concepts of Decentralized Finance, from AMMs to Oracles.
- **[[MOC - Case Studies]]**: In-depth analyses of major DeFi hacks and exploits.

Alternatively, feel free to use the search function or start from any note that piques your interest and follow the links.
