#case-study 
The Cream Finance is a [[Lending Protocol]] supports EVM compatible cross-chain, which was exploited three times with the vulnerabilities.
## Concepts
The Cream is a fork of the [[Compound Finance]], while Compound doesn't support assets with risk like [[Weird ERC20s]] or volatile price. But Cream supports those tokens, resulting to the exploits.
Although Cream gave 25% of the Cream tokens to Compound for security advising, this couldn't force the Compound to work for the Cream.
## Exploits
- [[Cream Finance Hack (October 2021)]]: Stolen $130m due to the [[Price Oracle Manipulation]].
