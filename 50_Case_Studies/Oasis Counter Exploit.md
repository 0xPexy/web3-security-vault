#case-study #centralization
Oasis Counter Exploit is the case of [[Contract Centralization]]. The team exploited their own centralization and moved the attacker funds by force. Although this shows the good result, this is actually the vulnerability.
## Concept
The hackers who exploited the Wormhole Bridge distributed the funds into multiple dApps including Oasis. The victims requested the UK court to order the centralization vulnerability in the Oasis to retrieve the stolen funds. That was accepted and the assets from attacker's vault were recovered.

### ELI5
The thief stole $100,000 from the rich and hided in his rent home. The police requested the landlord to use the master key to open up then retrieve the funds.

## Background
### Wormhole exploited
The [[Wormhole Exploit]] was done in Feb 2022 and the attacker distributed exploited funds to various DeFi platforms, including the Oasis.app. 
### Vulnerability in multi-sig
Oasis adopted [[Multi-Signatures]] to patch vulnerabilities for protecting user assets. White-hats informed the problems of the admin multi-sig design in on 16 Feb.
### UK Court Order
The UK Court ordered Oasis to exploit the centralization itself to recover the stolen funds.

## Process
1. Oasis changed the `Executor` address in `ServiceRegistry` to Oasis multi-sig wallet. This point is centralized to modify the address.
2. `AutomationBot::execute` calls the `Executor` from the `ServiceRegistry`, passes the authority to close the original attacker's vault and send assets to recovery address.

## Implications
Somebodies might think it's done with happy ending, but this case exactly shows the possibilities of behaviors like rug pulls if the access control is centralized.
