Centralization is a vulnerability that a system's critical operations or state are controlled by a single entity or a small groups.
## Concepts
In Web3 ecosystem, controls are algorithmically verified via digital signatures since there is no human middleman. Centralization means this verifications are only depend on few entities such as account, clients, infrastructures.
### ELI5
There is a safe box where You and I save our money, but I have the key. One day, I dropped the key to the manhole while I'm running outside and it's gone. We lost all of our funds.
### Types
- [[Contract Centralization]]: System is controlled by few accounts like [[EOA]], [[Multi-Signatures]]
- [[Infrastructure Centralization]]: Most of nodes depend on few cloud services like AWS.

### Advantages
- Easy management: Responsible for some keys.
- Efficiency: Cheap computation cost in both signing and verification, especially reduces [[Gas]] in on-chain.
### Disadvantages
- Easy to steal keys: Attack focusing on centralized key.
- Malicious behaviors: Unlike using multi-sigs, few admins can do lots of malicious behaviors.
