## Concept
**Software bug** is a defect in code level implementation that results to unexpected result. Not all bugs are the vulnerability, only the bug that causes the compromise of the CIA triad. See the example below in smart contract:
- Bug and Vulnerability: Bugs in core state-mutable functions.
- Bug but not Vulnerability: Bugs like in `external view` or `external pure` functions. Although these might mislead to unintended behaviors, do not break the core property itself.
