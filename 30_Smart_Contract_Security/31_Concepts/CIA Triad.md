**CIA triad** is three core properties-Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability-to be achieved in information security.
## Concepts
In information security, there are below three classic goals that system should achieve.
- Confidentiality: Data should not be available or disclosed to unauthorized subjects.
- [[Data Integrity]]: Data should be accurate and complete, not be modified by unauthorized.
- Availability: Data should be available when authorized users need.
Flaws that lead to compromising these properties are called [[Vulnerability]], and the malicious actor can [[Exploit]] the vulnerability.
